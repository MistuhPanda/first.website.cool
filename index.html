        <h2>What I Like to do</h2>
        <p>
            I spend most of my time playing video games and doing stuff like making websites on my computer. I also like to build computers and collect retro game consoles, although I still have a real life too.

        <h2>Why This Website Exists</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website because of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0&t" target="_blank">NetworkChuck video</a> It also gave me something to do because HTML is pretty easy and Super Mario 3D world starts to get a little boring after a while.
